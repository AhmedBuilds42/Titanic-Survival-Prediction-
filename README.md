# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster. It includes full data exploration, visualization, and machine learning implementation using Python.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand factors influencing survival.
- Perform data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering.
- Build models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict survival outcomes.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Name, gender, age
- Family size (SibSp + Parch)
- Ticket fare and embarkation port (Embarked)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates.
- First-class passengers had better chances of survival.
- Embarked location and family size influenced survival probability.

---

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Model evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
